    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Bruschetta is a classic Italian appetizer that is easy to make at home. Toasted bread is topped with tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and fresh basil. Use a high-quality balsamic vinegar for best results.</p>
      <p>The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette, but a rustic Italian bread is more authentic. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape. Toasting the bread creates a sturdier surface that won't get mushy when you add a juicy, flavorful topping.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

      <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon good quality balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
